        I am a Front-end deverloper from Munich, Germany. I help designers and
        companies to bring their ideas to real life. Creativity and logical
        thinking are skills that I have developed to connect ideas into quality
        products. <br><br> If you think Iâ€™d be a good match for your projects, contact
        me!
