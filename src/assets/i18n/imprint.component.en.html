    <h3>
    General Information on the Legal Bases of Data Processing on this Website
    </h3>
    <p>
    If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the
    basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a DSGVO, if
    special data categories according to Art. 9 para. 1 DSGVO are processed. In
    the case of express consent to the transfer of personal data to third
    countries, data processing is also based on Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO. If
    you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information on your
    end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the data processing is
    additionally based on § 25 para. 1 TDDG. The consent can be revoked at any
    time. If your data is required to fulfill a contract or to carry out
    pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1
    lit. b DSGVO. Furthermore, we process your data if it is necessary to fulfill
    a legal obligation on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c DSGVO. Data
    processing may also be based on our legitimate interest according to Art. 6
    para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. Information on the relevant legal bases in each
    individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of this data
    protection declaration.
    </p>
    <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
    <p>
    In the course of our business activities, we work with various external
    parties. In some cases, the transmission of personal data to these external
    parties is necessary. We only pass on personal data to external parties if
    this is necessary in the context of contract fulfillment, if we are legally
    obliged to do so (e.g., transfer of data to tax authorities), if we have a
    legitimate interest in passing on the data (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO), or
    if another legal basis permits the data transfer. When using processors, we
    only pass on personal data of our customers on the basis of a valid contract
    for order processing. In the case of joint processing, a contract for joint
    processing is concluded.
    </p>
    <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
    <p>
    Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent.
    You can revoke an already given consent at any time. The legality of the data
    processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the
    revocation.
    </p>
    <h3>

    THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR
    REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING
    BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH A PROCESSING IS
    BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL
    NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN PROVE COMPELLING
    LEGITIMATE REASONS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS,
    AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING SERVES TO ASSERT, EXERCISE, OR DEFEND LEGAL
    CLAIMS (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 PARA. 1 DSGVO).
    </p>
    <p>
    IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU
    HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
    CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO
    PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU
    OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL THEN NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING
    (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 PARA. 2 DSGVO).

    <p>
    In the event of violations of the DSGVO, data subjects have a right to file a
    complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of
    their habitual residence, their workplace, or the place of the alleged
    violation. The right to file a complaint exists without prejudice to other
    administrative or judicial remedies.
    </p>
    <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
    <p>
    You have the right to have data that we process automatically based on your
    consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or a third party in
    a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the
    data to another controller, this will only be done if it is technically
    feasible.
    </p>
    <h3>Information, Deletion, and Correction</h3>
    <p>
    Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to
    free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient,
    and the purpose of data processing, and if necessary, a right to correction or
    deletion of this data at any time. You can contact us at any time regarding
    this and other questions on the subject of personal data.
    </p>
    <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
    <p>
    You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
    personal data. You can contact us at any time regarding this. The right to
    restriction of processing exists in the following cases:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
        If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually
        need time to check this. For the duration of the review, you have the right
        to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the
        restriction of data processing instead of deletion.
    </li>
    <li>
        If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise,
        defend, or assert legal claims, you have the right to request the
        restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you have filed an objection according to Art. 21 para. 1 DSGVO, a balance
        must be made between your and our interests. As long as it is not yet clear
        whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of
        the processing of your personal data.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data may -
    apart from its storage - only be processed with your consent or for the
    assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the
    rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public
    interest of the European Union or a member state.
    </p>
    <h3>Objection to Advertising Emails</h3>
    <p>
    The use of contact data published within the scope of the imprint obligation
    for sending unsolicited advertising and information materials is hereby
    prohibited. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take
    legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising
    information, such as spam emails.
